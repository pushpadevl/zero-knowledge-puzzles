Why does this works? 
    signal input in[2];
    signal output out;
    out <== in[0] * in[1];. 
But this one does compile but gives "Scalar size does not match at the end?  
    signal input in[2];
    signal output out; 
    signal n2; 
    n2 <-- in[0] * in[1];
    out <== n2;


The issue you're encountering is related to how Circom handles witness generation and constraint satisfaction. Let me explain the difference:

## Working Code:
```circom
signal input in[2];
signal output out;
out <== in[0] * in[1];
```

This works because:
- `<==` performs both **witness assignment** and **constraint addition**
- It directly assigns `in[0] * in[1]` to `out` and adds the constraint `out === in[0] * in[1]`
- The circuit knows exactly what `out` should be

## Problematic Code:
```circom
signal input in[2];
signal output out;
signal n2;
n2 <-- in[0] * in[1];
out <== n2;
```

This has issues because:
- `<--` only does **witness assignment** (no constraints)
- `n2 <-- in[0] * in[1]` assigns the value but doesn't add any constraints about `n2`
- `out <== n2` tries to assign `n2` to `out`, but since `n2` has no constraints, the circuit can't verify its correctness

## The "Scalar size does not match" Error

This error typically occurs when:
1. The witness generation phase computes values differently than the constraint satisfaction phase expects
2. There's a mismatch between computed values and constrained values
3. Intermediate signals aren't properly constrained

## How to Fix It:

You need to add explicit constraints for intermediate signals:

```circom
signal input in[2];
signal output out;
signal n2;
n2 <-- in[0] * in[1];  // Witness assignment
n2 === in[0] * in[1];  // Add constraint
out <== n2;
```

Or more simply, just use the direct approach:
```circom
signal input in[2];
signal output out;
out <== in[0] * in[1];
```

The key principle in Circom is that **every signal used in constraints must have its value properly constrained**, not just assigned as a witness.
