Great question! This is a subtle but important distinction in Circom related to **constraint satisfaction** and **witness generation**.

## Why the First Version Works:

```circom
signal input numerator;
signal input denominator;
signal output out;
signal quotient;
component den_zerocheck = IsZero();
den_zerocheck.in <== denominator;
den_zerocheck.out === 0;
quotient <-- numerator \ denominator;
out <== quotient;
```

This works because:
1. **The `IsZero()` component adds constraints** that indirectly constrain the relationship between inputs
2. **The constraint `den_zerocheck.out === 0`** ensures `denominator â‰  0`
3. Even though `quotient` only has witness assignment (`<--`), the circuit has **enough constraints overall** to be satisfiable
4. The `IsZero()` component creates a **constraint system** that the prover can satisfy

## Why the Second Version Fails:

```circom
signal input numerator;
signal input denominator;
signal output out;
signal quotient;
quotient <-- numerator \ denominator;
out <== quotient;
```

This fails because:
1. **No constraints exist** relating `numerator`, `denominator`, and `quotient`
2. `quotient <-- numerator \ denominator` only assigns a witness value
3. `out <== quotient` creates the constraint `out === quotient`, but there's **no constraint ensuring `quotient` is the correct division result**
4. The circuit is **underconstrained** - a malicious prover could set `quotient` to any value

## The Core Issue:

The "Scalar size does not match" and "Proof.json does not exist" errors occur because:
- **Witness generation** computes `quotient = numerator / denominator`
- **Constraint satisfaction** has no way to verify this is correct
- The circuit fails to generate a valid proof because it can't satisfy the minimal constraints

## The Fix:

You need to add constraints that verify the division is correct:

```circom
signal input numerator;
signal input denominator;
signal output out;
signal quotient;
signal remainder;

quotient <-- numerator \ denominator;
remainder <-- numerator % denominator;

// Add the division constraint
numerator === quotient * denominator + remainder;

// Ensure remainder < denominator
component lt = LessThan(252);
lt.in[0] <== remainder;
lt.in[1] <== denominator;
lt.out === 1;

out <== quotient;
```

**Key Principle**: In Circom, every computation must be **both witnessed and constrained**. The `IsZero()` component in your first example provided additional constraints that made the circuit satisfiable, even though the division itself wasn't explicitly constrained.
