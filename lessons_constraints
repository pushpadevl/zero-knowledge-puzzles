Constraint generation can be combined with signal assignment with the operator <== with the signal to be assigned on the left hand side of the operator.

out <== 1 - a*b;

Which is equivalent to:

out <-- 1 - a*b;
out === 1 â€“ a*b;

As mentioned before, assigning a value to a signal using <-- and --> is considered dangerous and should, in general, be combined with adding constraints with ===, which describe by means of constraints which the assigned values are. For example:

a <-- b/c;
a*c === b;
